    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Would you believe that brownies made with just cocoa powder can be rich, fudgy, and irresistable?</p>

        <p>This is the recipe you can make from scratch when youâ€™re craving something chocolate. It is about 
            to become your go-to recipe when you are in a hurry.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>    
            <li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>1 cup cocoa powder* (see note)</li>
            <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees farenheit. Grease a 9x13 inch pan with butter or line with parchment paper.
            In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter and sugar. Make sure the butter mixture is almost room 
            temperature and then add the eggs and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Beat until well incorporated. Beating in the eggs well is what forms that signature brownie crust on top.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Whisk until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
            Bake at 350 degrees for 28-32 minutes or until center is set. Let cool at least slightly before cutting into bars.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>*NOTE: I like to use dutch process cocoa powder in my brownies. It has a richer, deeper chocolate flavor and is much darker.</p>
