    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A crispy, sky-high muffin top, full of chocolate chips, soft and buttery on the inside - a perfect way to start your morning!</p>

        <p>The key to the perfect bakery style muffin is to have just enough leavening agents (baking soda and baking powder) to create that 
            puffy dome when baking, but not so much that you can taste it. Baking at an initial high temperature will cause the air bubbles 
            in the batter to expand even further. This will help give the muffin a soft and fluffy texture and also create the high rise.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>    
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Spray a 12 cup muffin tray with non-stick cooking spray or line with paper liners.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, toss together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and chocolate chips. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sugar, eggs, milk and vanilla. Slowly add to the dry ingredients. 
                Gently fold together until JUST combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter into the 12 muffin cups and bake at 425°F for 5 minutes. Then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F 
                and continue to bake for another 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Do not 
                overbake or the muffins will be dry. Let cool for about 5-10 minutes and enjoy warm.</li>
